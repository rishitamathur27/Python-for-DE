In this project, I have built an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the Spotify API on AWS from scratch. The pipeline will retrieve data from teh Spotify API, transform it to a desired format, and load it into an AWS data store.

* Integrating with Spotify API and extracting data.
* Deploying code on AWS Lambda for data extraction.
* Adding trigger to run the extraction automatically.
* Writing transformation function.
* Building automated trigger on transformation function.
* Store files on S3 properly.
* Building analytics tables on data files using Glue and Athena.
